## Contributing
I am thinking of adding a new feature to calculate the cost of a taxi trip with Dubai Taxi. You can send me a Twitter DM @armstrong2035 if you would like to do peer coding with me.
I would also like to improve the design of the page. It is a simple calculator, but whatever is worth doing is worth doing well. Shoot me a Twitter DM @armstrong2035 if you want to help design.
